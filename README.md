## Hello There, ðŸ‘‹  I am Tyler Martin!

I am a programmer and hardware enthusiast working to complete a PhD in computer science. I currently have a Masters degree in computer science with most of my graduate work relating to computer vision. I work primarily with high level programming still, but I have a great interest in low level hardware design, and have recently begun working with FPGA designs (one of which can be found in my repositories). I am also currently working a lot in data mining, using python to implement supervised and unsupervised learning models. 

I worked a lot with javascript within the electron framework in the past, and am proficient in the surrounding languages such as html, php, css, node, vue, and a few other sub languages. However, I primarily work in C++ and use python for prototyping and frameworks, in addition to using Python for mathematical work.

I am an avid linux user, although I know my way around Windows as well. I work primarily with debian based distributions, with the main one being Ubuntu.
