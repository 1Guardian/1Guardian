## Hello there, I am Tyler Martin!

I am a programmer working to complete a Master's in computer science with a certificate in mobile computing. I work primarily with high level programming right now, but I have a great interest in low level hardware design, and microarchitecture design. I am also currently working a lot in data mining, using python to implement supervised and unsupervised learning models. 

I worked a lot with javascript within the electron framework in the past, and am proficient in the surrounding languages such as html, php, css, node, vue, and a few other sub languages. However, I primarily work in C++ and python now, emphasizing on using Python for mathematical work and C++ for all other programming. 

I am an avid linux user, although I know my way around Windows as well. I work primarily with debian based distributions, with the main one being Ubuntu.
